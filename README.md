Intro

Render Automaterrr lets you render multiple comps painlessly, handles output naming, and even formats a notification message to share with the rest of the team. 

Keep in mind that this is currently a beta script, so make sure to save your work. Most importantly, Render Automaterrr has only been used on PCs so far.

Here’s how to use Render Automaterrr.

Step 1
Launch Render Automaterrr from the Scripts menu.

Step 2
Copy the path of your dailies directory to the Dailies Folder field.

Step 3
Select your output folder in the project tab (the folder where all of your output comps are located). Nested comps within the output folder are fine.

Step 4
Press the Select Output Folder button - this will copy the output folder location to the Output Comps Folder field.

Step 5
Press the Scan Output Folder For Comps button - this will load all of the comps in the Output Folder into the script.

Step 6
Choose the comps you want to render.

Step 7
Press the Render Selected Comps button

Step 8
You are done. Selected comps are automatically sent to Media Encoder for rendering. Render Automaterrr places the renders in a dated folder within the dailies directory, and automatically adds the date and time to each filename to keep everything organized.

Important note - Media Encoder will use the settings from the previous render job for these files.

Render Automaterrr also give you a formatted list of what was sent to Media Encoder to share with the rest of the team. To copy the notification message, just select the window and Ctrl-C.

Change List/Requests
●	Have options to include / exclude date / time in file name appending
●	For image sequences, automatically place in subfolders, named by comp name
●	Have option to send the render to After Effects instead of Media Encoder - and if that’s the case, allow choice of output modules. And if it’s in After Effects, have an option to not automatically launch the render.
